# A visualisation of beach trips from Manchester

This project's webgl visualisation uses code from [WebGL Curves Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/webgl-globe-2-z7x8jy)

The code above was changed to include event listeners and info box for the beaches.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scr

The project was inspired by [The World's Top Beaches: A Statistician's Guide](https://www.1843magazine.com/data-graphic/what-the-numbers-say/the-worlds-top-beaches-a-statisticians-guide ) and my own struggles with finding a beach destination on a student budget.

## Data Collection

Data collection was carried out using selenium's python bindings. The code for that can be found in the iPython notebook
in /data/Beach Data Collection.ipynb. The links for each of the beach list is in that notebook as well.
